# Deenice Finds â€” Static Website (v2)
Includes compare page, GA4 & Facebook Pixel placeholders, search suggestions, mobile nav fix, product color preview overlays, and calculator with glassy ECF0FE styling.

Important: automated fetching of GSM Arena is blocked by robots.txt in many environments. The compare tool uses local data at `data/compare.json`. To import GSM Arena specs automatically you must run a server-side scraper/proxy that fetches the GSM Arena pages and returns JSON to the client (or pre-populate `data/compare.json`).

Files to edit:
- data/products.json
- data/compare.json
- js/config.js
